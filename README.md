# Koko Framework (Not Maintained)
A client-side routing framework for single-page [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) applications. 

Koko is built on Knockout’s component feature and supports loading nested components. Loosely speaking, Koko is to Knockout what [Angular UI Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) is to [Angular](https://angularjs.org/).

### Status
I'm not currently using Knockout for any projects, so this project is not maintained. 

### Documentation
See [the docs](./docs/source/index.rst) for documentation.
