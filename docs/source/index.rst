Welcome to Koko
==============

Koko is a client-side routing framework for single-page `Knockout`_  applications. 

Koko is built on Knockout's **component** feature and supports loading nested components. Loosely speaking, Koko is to Knockout what `Angular UI Router`_ is to `Angular`_.

.. WARNING::
   Koko is in the early stages of development. A stable (**1.0**) release is
   forthcoming. In the meantime, use at your own risk.
